			<p>	A Yellow Belly Turtle is just any regular common house hold turtle, so it has the ability to swim and breatch underwater. It has to be contained in a tank with water. It eats turtle food that can be found in most stores. A very slow but extremly sturdy pet. Can be a little snappy though, so it's not good for children or even for just average play with adults. Has to have it's tank cleaned out regularly. Its size is nothing to big to handle, but it can be slippery after coming out of the tank. Turtles can carry disseases such as salmonella, so always wash hands after carrying this pet. If your looking for a pet that needs a lot of maintaining but it's a pet that lots of people like to see, a turtle is a good option.</p>

			<p>	The Komodo Dragon is one of the biggest lizards that you can find. It eats all kinds of food, sych as rats, smaller lizards, insects, human food, etc... It can weigh up to 200 pounds, so might not fit in with most homes. Has to be trained to not attack humans, but when it is, it can be a very nice and useful pet to have. No special bin of cage is needed to hold this animal, but if you want to you need a strong and big cage to do so, becasue of its amazing size. It will eat most of the unwanted guest inside of your house like bugs and rats, but it will also eat other pets like cats and dongs, so be very careful if it's not your only pet. If your looking for a big lizard that can guard your house and be a nice lizard to humans with some training, the Komodo Dragon is a great option.</p>

			<p>A Orpington is a breed of chicken that has a good size, and is very useful. They are not really used to play around with, but they are very good at providing eggs for you. You can have a chicken nest for you Orpington, or just letting it roam in you backyard is fine if you know it wont be able to escape. All the Orpington needs to eat are seeds, but it will eat othr things as well. If you want a pet that is more useful than it being an actual pet, the Orpington seems like a good choice.</p>

			<p>A pet rock is a pet that is a rock... some say that at night when your sleeping, the rock moves around the house to scavenge for food. If spotted at this time, the rock will become like a normal rock again. Their is no footage of this happening, but people say they can hear is sliding against the ground when they are waking up. If you want a pet that does nothing when you are actually awake, then a pet rock is perfect for you.</p>

			<p>In japan, the work neko means cat, but because of the weird weeaboos of America, the word neko mostly refers to a girl that is also a cat. A neko is basically a normal human girl that has some cat features such as the tail and ears. Nekos can make pussing sounds and have similar behavior as a normal cat, but they can speak eanglish and japanese. They eat notmal human food, and can be  a great help around the house, because they are very loyal and will help out with things if treated properly. If yoy are lonely and want help with everyday life, having a neko sounds amazing to me.</p>

		<p> Adopt one, or you are a very bad person! >:( </p>
		<p>BTW, Nekos are my favorite animal.</p>
